Most people buy a new car every eight years.

Paul is an exception. He still drives his first car, which he bought nearly 50 years ago.

It gets lots of comments.

“Look at that antique!”

“Grandpa had a car like that.”

Paul just smiles. He took his wife on their first date in his car. He took his kids to soccer games in it. He drove it to work. He shuttled his parents to doctors in it.

People tell Paul he should trade his car in. But how do you part with something that shares your heart and soul?

More tapping.

Horton â€“ always mumbling, always ready to die, too yellow to end it himself. Always talked about it himself, always said it himself. I never thought he'd take it this far. Never thought he'd have the guts, but here they are right in front of me.

Cold sink, cold tile, cold everything. Heat long gone. Heater long busted. But the real culprit of the cold is Horton himself.

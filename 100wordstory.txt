It’s wildly impractical. When I backed out of the wedding, Katie’s father took it hard and ran for city council. Swung his weight around. This—the road thing—is temporary, he promised. A favor, an experiment, depending on who he bribed. On my way home from work, I have to pass Katie’s house. No way around it. Believe me. Needless to say, everyone despises me. And there’s the billboards. “700 bucks on fish, Mike. You son of a bitch” on the corner of Willow. “For chrissakes: call her” at the ramp onto the highway. Another says “Please,” where I always turn back.
